    "response": "Gestational diabetes (GDM) is diabetes that is diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. It is often caused by underlying \u221a\u00fc-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance worsened by decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM is higher in Eastern and Southeast Asian countries compared to Western and African countries. In Singapore, GDM occurs in around 1 in 4 to 5 pregnant women. GDM can increase the risk of maternal and neonatal complications such as preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia.   GDM is diagnosed through glucose testing during pregnancy. If diabetes is first identified during pregnancy, it may represent undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes. It is important for pregnant women to be screened for GDM to ensure proper management and reduce the risk of complications for both the mother and baby.",

GDM is  diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester.
