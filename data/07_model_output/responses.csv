What is gestational diabetes and how is it diagnosed?,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is diabetes that is diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. It is often caused by underlying ÃŸ-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance worsened by decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM is higher in Eastern and Southeast Asian countries compared to Western and African countries. In Singapore, GDM occurs in around 1 in 4 to 5 pregnant women. GDM can increase the risk of maternal and neonatal complications such as preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia.   GDM is diagnosed through glucose testing during pregnancy. If diabetes is first identified during pregnancy, it may represent undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes. It is important for pregnant women to be screened for GDM to ensure proper management and reduce the risk of complications for both the mother and baby.",".1 2 3 Managing GDM to improve outcomesFirst published: 28 May 2018  Last updated: 22 August 2022 Women with diabetes during pregnancy (defined as  glucose levels higher than normal, including  diabetes, GDM, and pre-diabetes) are at increased risk  of maternal and neonatal complications (such as preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia)  compared to those without diabetes.1 When diabetes  is first identified during pregnancy, this may  represent undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes.

What are the key differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in terms of causes and symptoms?,"The key differences between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes lie in their causes and symptoms. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by a fast onset, often over a few days, and is caused by the immune system attacking insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetes may not have obvious symptoms or they can be easily missed, and it is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and lack of physical activity.   In terms of symptoms, both types of diabetes share common signs such as frequent urination, thirst, weight loss, hunger, blurred vision, and numbness or tingling in hands/feet. However, Type 1 diabetes can lead to serious complications like Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) if symptoms are ignored, while Type 2 diabetes can result in complications such as Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome (HHS) when blood sugar levels are dangerously high.","Symptoms It can be difficult to distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes. They share many similar symptoms, and the differences are slight.

Can you explain how insulin works in a healthy person versus someone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes?,"In a healthy person, insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps control blood sugar levels by moving glucose into cells to generate energy and maintain normal body functions.  In someone with Type 1 diabetes, there is a fast onset of symptoms over a few days. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) when ketones build up in the bloodstream.  In Type 2 diabetes, symptoms may not be obvious or easily missed. If ignored, it can lead to serious complications such as Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome (HHS) when blood sugar levels are dangerously high and the body becomes severely dehydrated.   Both types of diabetes can benefit from adopting a healthy lifestyle, including maintaining a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet to help manage blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of complications.","How insulin works in a healthy person Insulin is a hormone that helps control the blood sugar level in your body. It is produced by beta cells in one of our  organs called the pancreas (insulin factory). Insulin moves sugar (glucose) into the  cells, which is then used to generate energy  and maintain normal body functions.

What role does excess body fat especially internal fat around organs play in the development of type 2 diabetes?,"Excess body fat, especially internal fat around organs, plays a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Over time, excess fat in the body can lead to insulin resistance, where the body cells do not respond well to insulin. This means that more insulin is needed to move sugar from the bloodstream into body cells, putting stress on the pancreas. Additionally, excess fat can lead to higher blood sugar levels, causing the pancreas to work harder to produce more insulin to control blood sugar levels. Ultimately, this can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. It is important to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.","Fat surrounding the organs and  muscles (this is not visible to us)Where is the fat stored?

"For someone with type 1 diabetes, can you explain the concept of carbohydrate counting and its importance?","Carbohydrate counting is a method used by individuals with Type 1 diabetes to manage their blood sugar levels. It involves calculating the amount of carbohydrates in the food and drinks consumed and adjusting insulin doses accordingly. When your body digests carbohydrates, they are broken down into glucose, which is your body's main source of energy. By accurately counting carbohydrates and matching insulin doses to the amount consumed, individuals can better control their blood sugar levels.  The importance of carbohydrate counting lies in its ability to help individuals with Type 1 diabetes maintain stable blood sugar levels. By accurately dosing insulin based on carbohydrate intake, individuals can prevent blood sugar spikes and dips, reducing the risk of complications associated with poorly controlled diabetes. It allows for better management of blood sugar levels, leading to improved overall health and well-being.","Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient  found in foods and drinks When your body digests food and drinks  that contain carbohydrates, they are  broken down into glucose, which is your  bodyâ€™s preferred source of energy.
