GDM is  diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester.  The pathophysiology is often underlying √ü-cell  dysfunction or insulin resistance worsened by  decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy.1,2The prevalence of GDM in Eastern and Southeast Asian  countries is approximately 1 in 10, which is higher than  Western and African countries.3 In Singapore, GDM occurs  in around 1 in 4 to 5 pregnant women‚Äîa higher  prevalence than other countries in the Eastern and  Southeast Asian region'\u001b[0m,\n",

This is a logical starting point and provides a clear definition for the reader. \\n\\nThe submission then moves on to discuss the prevalence of gestational diabetes, providing specific data about its occurrence in Singapore. This information is relevant and adds depth to the answer, but it is also well-organized, following logically from the initial definition.\\n\\nNext, the submission discusses the risks associated with gestational diabetes, which is a logical next step after defining the condition and discussing its prevalence. This information is important for understanding why gestational diabetes is a concern.\\n\\nFinally, the submission explains how gestational diabetes is diagnosed, which directly answers the second part of the input question. This is a logical conclusion to the submission, wrapping up the answer in a coherent and organized manner.\\n\\nOverall, the submission is coherent, well-structured, and organized. It follows a logical flow of information, from defining gestational diabetes, to discussing its prevalence and risks, to explaining how it is diagnosed. Each part of the submission is relevant to the input question and contributes to a comprehensive answer.\\n\\nY'\u001b[0m,\n",
