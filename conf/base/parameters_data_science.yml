# Hint: Look inside response.csv file to see the index of the latest
# data. Subtract 1 from it and that would be your new `start_index`.

# For example:
# If the index of the last row in response.csv is 52. Then the new
#  `start_index` will be 52 - 1 = 51.

# Note: While the maximum value of `end_index` can be some arbitrarily large
# number, look inside queries.csv to see the the total number of rows.

# For example:
# If the last index in queries.csv is 238, you have a total of 237 queries since
# the first row is the header. Then the new `end_index` will be 237 - 1 = 236
# because Python is a 0-indexing language.
start_index: 0
end_index: 10
